** phylocom.R - R-functions for incorporating phylocom **

This is _not_ an R package.  You'll need to include
source("phylocom.R") in any script that uses these function.

No comprehensive documentation yet - sorry.  You'll need to look at the
functions themselves to see the arguments they can take.  I suggest
looking through and running the test.phylocom.R script in order to see
how to use the functions:

> source("test.phylocom.R", echo=T, print.eval = T)

NB: the phylocom executable _must_ be in your path.  I.e., if you are
still running phylocom as ./phylocom these script will not work as
they are.  Check any basic unix book.  An alternative (and perhaps the
only way to fix this on Windows) is to edit phylocom.R so that all the
calls to "phylocom ..." are changed to "/path/to/phylocom ..."
