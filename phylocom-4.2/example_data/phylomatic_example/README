Phylomatic `Version 2' - on your desktop!

NEW: multiple levels of nestedness in clade info for taxa to be matched
     i.e. - not just Family Genus Species.  See sample taxa file.

NEW: Preserves branch length info in reference tree.

Sample reference trees:

R20080417.new - Current phylomatic tree (see http://phylodiversity/phylomatic/)

davies.bl.new - Jonathan Davies angiosperm supertree.

Run with:

../phylomatic -l -f R20080417.new -t eg_taxa

(Note the -l switch needed for new lowercase phylomatic trees)

FULL DOCUMENTATION coming.  Please be patient.

PLEASE send bug reports to Cam: cwebb@oeb.harvard.edu
